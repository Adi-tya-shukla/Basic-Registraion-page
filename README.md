Registration page 



This is a simple web page for booking appointments, and it includes a form that asks for the user's name, email, phone number, and preferred date and time for a call. The user fills out the form and clicks on the "Confirm Booking" button to submit it.

Once the form is submitted, the data is stored in the browser's local storage using JavaScript. The data is also displayed on the same web page, below the form, in a list format. The user can see the list of appointments they have booked, and they can also edit or remove their appointments using the corresponding buttons provided next to each entry.

The web page is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code defines the structure of the page, the CSS code defines the styles and layout of the page, and the JavaScript code handles the form submission, data storage, and data display logic.
